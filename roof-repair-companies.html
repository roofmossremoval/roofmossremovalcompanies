Factors Influencing TimeframeThe severity of moss infestation plays a pivotal role in determining how long a project might take.  While initial expenses for professional help may be higher compared to buying DIY supplies, it's important to consider long-term savings from avoiding potential roof repairs caused by improper handling during self-removal attempts.
